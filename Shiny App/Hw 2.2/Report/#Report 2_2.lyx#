Obtain the estimated odds ratio and confidence intervals of crossing for
 car vs.
 truck at each traffic location.

We have calculated the odds ratio for car vs.
 truck depending on traffic, calculating the partial tables and applying
 the

Interpret them and use the fourfold display to help you understand the output.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

The odds ratio is greater than 1 for low traffic which means that the odds
 of an elk crossing when a car is passing are higher than the odds of crossing
 when it is a truck.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of high traffic the odds ratio is less than 1 which means that the
 odds of an elk crossing whit cars are lower than the odds for trucks.

\begin_layout Standard
Hoewer, since the confidence interval contains the value 1, we are going
 to assume that the odds ratio of crossing for cars is comparable to the
 odds ratio of crossing for trucks:

\begin_layout Standard
If we use the fourfold representation, we can see a graphical representation
 for the odds ratio of each traffic level.
 It includes confidence rings.
 If they don't overlap, that indicates an association between crossing and
 cars, every odds ration is significantly different from 0.

\begin_layout Standard
In the display we can see a strong positive association for low traffic
 (
\begin_inset Formula $5.286842$
\end_inset

).
 The rings don’t overlap and the non-principal diagonal sectors have less
 area than the principal diagonal ones (odds ratio greater than 1).
 On the other hand the odds of crossing is essentially identical for cars
 and trucks in case of high traffic (odds ration almost 1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This result is an example of Simpson's paradox.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use also the mosaic function to interpret partial tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \hspace{}
\length 15bp
\end_inset

From the mosaic plot below we see that there is no systematic association
 between different actions and the type of vehicle - except among the action
 of trucks under low traffic.
 The tiles show that there are relatively less trucks in low traffic with
 crossing that the hypothesis of independence would predict.

Obtain the estimated odds ratio of crossing vs.
 retreat without taking into account the third (control) variable.
 Would it be correct to exclude the effect of that third variable?

The odds of “success” (crossing) for car vehicles are higher than for trucks.

\begin_layout Standard
Taking into account (controlling for) traffic, the odds of crossing are
 lower for car vehicles than for trucks in case of high traffic.
 Just the reverse direction that the marginal table showed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It´s an example of Simpson’s Paradox: The result that a marginal association
 can have a different direction from each conditional association.
 It can be dangerous to “collapse” contingency tables over a third control
 variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Elks marginal table, where the odds ratio was 2.676251, we observe
 a strong positive association (odds ratio greater than 1).

\begin_layout Standard
The very low p-value (0.0001) indicates that we can reject the Homogeneity
 of the Odds Ratio through the two levels of traffic.
 We cannot assume that the conditional relationship between any pair of
 variables given the third one is the same at each level of the third variable.
