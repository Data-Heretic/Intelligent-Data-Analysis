\begin_layout Section
Plot the series and briefly comment on the characteristics you observe (stationa
rity, trend, seasonality, ...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we are group 10, we have the Monthly interest rate on unsubsidised loans
 for house purchase (percentage).
 Monthly time series from January 1995 to September 2013.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing we did was plot the series:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Float figure

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can appreciate that the time series has an obvious global downward trend
 without seasonality (so it is not a stationary series).
 We can appreaciate also upward subtrends in some intervals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Obtain a plot of the decomposition of the series, using stl().
 Use an additive decomposition or a multiplicative one, depending on your
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use the function forecast() to forecast future values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multiplicative decomposition is useful when the logarithmic transformation
 makes a difference in the appearance of your series and shows more constant
 variance.
 Does the remainder look like a white noise to you?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
White noise is just a group of independent, identically distributed variables,
 with zero mean and constant variance.
 Answer to this point just visually or plot the ACF and PACF of the remainder
 part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fit an ARIMA model to your time series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Decide on whether to work with your original variable or with the log transform
 one (use plot and tsdisplay of both variables, the transformed one and
 the original one).
 Remember that logarithmic transformation is useful to stabilize the variance.
 If both plots look almost the same to you, just use the original data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Are you going to consider a seasonal component? If the answer is yes, identify
 s.
 You can use the periodogram (function tsdisplay with parameter “plot.type=spectr
um”), ACF (with significant correlations on lag s and its multiples), seasonplot
() and monthplot().
 For montlhy data, s = 12; for quarterly data s = 4.
 Declare this frequency when you define your time-series in R, regardless
 of including or not a seasonal term in your model.
 This will permit you to use the functions seasonplot (package forecast)
 or monthplot (built-in function).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Decide on the values of d and D to make your series stationary.
 D values are not usually greater than 1.
 You can use the standard deviation procedure and stationary tests (adf.test,
 kpss.test).
 Also, functions like ndiffs and nsdiffs may be useful.
 Don’t be surprised if that group of tools give you contradictory results.
 Just, make decision to keep going.
 Plots of the ACF and PACF also help.
 If you can draw a pattern out of the ACF and PACF function, then stop differenc
ing and start modelling.
 If that pattern doesn’t work, then consider rethinking the part where you
 took differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Identify values for p and q for the regular part and P and Q for the seasonal
 part.
 Start with low values and then increase them, one at a time.
 Fit different models and compare them using AICc and checking the residuals.
 Check also the correlation between the coefficients of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Make diagnostic of the residuals for the final model chosen (autocorrelations,
 zero mean, normality).
 Use plots and tests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Once you have found a suitable model, repeating the fitting model process
 several times if necessary, use it to make forecasts.
 Plot them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use the function getrmse to compute the test set RMSE of some of the models
 you have already fiited.
 Which is the one minimizing it? Use the last year of observations (12 observati
ons for monthly data, 4 observations for quarterly data) as the test set.
