\begin_layout Section
Plot price vs.
 caratage and log(price) vs.
 caratage.
 Decide on which response variable is better to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

For linear regression models, we want to make sure that there is a linear
 relationship between the input and output variables.
 Taking the log to the price makes the relationship between price and carat
 looks more linear.
 This is our main objective for linear regression, As we can see in the
 below graphs, plotting the log price gives a better representation of the
 variables.

\begin_layout Section
Find a suitable way to include, besides caratage, the other categorical
 information available.
 Use the worst level of each categorical variable as the reference category
 and HRD for certication institution.
 Comment on the model and perform a basic analysis of the residuals.

We have choose VS2 (very sligthly imperfect 2) for Clarity, I for ColourPurity
 and HRD for certification institution as reference categories.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see in the summary below, the overall model has a Multiple R-squared
 of 0.9723, so the model is able to predict any Y using X with accuracy of
 97%.

Test of significance for the overall model is 
\begin_inset Formula $2.2e-16$
\end_inset

.
 We can reject the null hypothesis and say that not all coeficients are
 significally equal to 0, even though CertifierGIA has low p-values and
 it is.
 We can conclude that the variables are significant for the model.
 We can say the following regarding the variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
For the weight coefficient,
\series default
 since the dependent variable is expressed in log, then we can say either:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In log scale, If you increase one unit of cartage , log(price) will increase
 by 2.855
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Price scale, If you increase one unit of cartage the price of diamond
 is multiplied by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2.88}=17.37466$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
For the color purity coefficient,
\series default
 since the dependent variable is expressed in log and reference category
 is “I”, then we can say that the price of “ColourPurityD” is exp(0.41)=1.53
 times the price of “ColourPurityI” , we can conclude that “ColourPurityD”
 is much better than the reference category.
 Also it can be appreciated that the influence on the price is grouwing
 the better the color purity is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
For the clarity coefficient
\series default
 we have a similar situation, we can appreciate that the influence on the
 price is greater the bettter clarity the diamond has, although there is
 not much difference between the two best levels (IF and VS1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
For the certifiers coefficient
\series default
 we can see that the HRD and GIA have significally the same influence in
 the price and both of them influence a higher price han IGI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \hspace{}

In order to make some interpretation on the residuals, we started by plotting
 a graph using the plot function for the model.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the graph we can see that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The residuals don’t behave nicely , there is a nonlinear relationship between
 the outcome and predictor (seem to be following a quadratic relation not
 a linear one).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Residuals seems to come from a normal distribution, but with lighter tails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the scale location plot, we can see that the residuals are spread somehow
 equally along with the range of the predictor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In Cooks distance plot, we can see that there are 3 influential values ,
 which are: 110, 214 and 223
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \hspace{}
\length 15bp
\end_inset

We can test residuals dependency using “Durbin Watson test”, the p-value
 for the test is p-value ( < 2.2e-16 ) , so we can reject the null hypothesis
 which means that the residuals are dependent and have correlation (not
 a good interpretation, residuals should be independent)

\begin_layout Section
Try two dierent remedial actions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
3.1-3.5
\series default
 Create a new categorical variable to segregate the stones according to
 caratage: let's say less than 0.5 carats small, 0.5 to less than 1 carat
 (medium) and 1 carat and over (large).
 Make small as the reference category.
 Add this new variable to the existing model as well as an interaction term
 between this new variable and caratage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
3.6
\series default
 Include the square of carat as a new explanatory variable.
 It avoids the subjectivity of clusters denition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Is this regression model satisfactory? Are the standard assumptions of linear
 regression validated? Are the numerical estimates sensible?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regression model is satisfactory as the overall test of significance
 for the model is 2.2e-16 and R2 = 0.9953 (there is an obvious improvement
 in the model compared to model 1).

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the assumtions for linear regression, we have applied the following
 tests:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Durbin Watson test: The p-value < 2.2e-16, which means that the residuals
 have a correlation (not good interpretation for linear regression models)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Jarque-Bera: The p-value = 0.172, which means accepting the null hypothesis,
 so residuals follow a normal distribution (good interpretation about the
 model) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Breusch-Pagan: The p-value equals to 0.0007143, so we will reject the null
 hypothesis that means variances are not constant.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interpret the interaction parameter med*carat.
 What can we infer on the incremental pricing of caratage in the 3 clusters?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can interpret that the interaction term for 'med*weight' is significant
 as p-value is less than 0.05 (5% level).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the dependent variable (price) is expressed in logs, then we can say
 that if all the variables are equal, the increase in price for a diamond
 of medium size is exp(-2.04)= 0.13 times the increase in the price of a small
 diamond.
 This means that the price of diamond for small ones increases faster than
 medium ones, when you increase the carat by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Which is more highly valued: colour or clarity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colour is more highly valued since the best colour purity influence more
 in the price that the best clarity (and the same for the subsequent levels)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
All other things being equal, what is the average price diference between
 a grade D diamond and another one graded (a) I (b) E? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The log(price) is 0.47 higher for a D diamond than for a I diamond
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The log(price) is 0.08 higher for a D diamond than for a E diamond
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
All other things being equal, are there price diferences amongst the stones
 appraised by the GIA, IGI and HRD?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this model, all the coeficients related to the certifiers are significally
 equal to 0, so the prices are not influenced by them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Include the square of carat as a new explanatory variable.
 It avoids the subjectivity of clusters denition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have replace carat by the square of carat in order to avoid relation
 between variables, obtaining the following result:

\begin_layout Section
Which of the two remedial actions do you prefer and why? Think on terms
 of interpretability and validity of the assumptions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both models we have a good 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

 and a good p-value, the main difference in the models can be seen here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The linearity of residuals , model2 is more linear than model3 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normality , model2 behaves better compared to model3 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Variance equality, model 3 is better than model2.
